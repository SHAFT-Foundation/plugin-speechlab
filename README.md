## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Missing credentials"** | Set `SPEECHLAB_EMAIL` and `SPEECHLAB_PASSWORD` environment variables |
| **"Project timeout"** | Increase `SPEECHLAB_MAX_WAIT_TIME_MINUTES` for longer audio files |
| **"Invalid audio URL"** | Ensure URL is publicly accessible (HTTPS recommended) |
| **"Unsupported language"** | Use [standard language codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) |
